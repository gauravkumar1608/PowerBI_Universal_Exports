## Background to problem statement:
Universal Export is a garments manufacturing company operating out of Southampton, United Kingdom. It manufactures various types of plain, unmarked, unlabelled clothing for retailers, wholesalers, and others such as t-shirt, hoodies, jacket, etc. Retailers purchase the blank garment from Universal Export and put on their own logo or design before selling them at a markup price.

## Aim of the project:
The aim of project is to produce two reports which would help the management team in deciding how it should invest in its manufacturing capacity going forward, and decide how to restructure the sales team after a recent resignation of former head of sales.

Report 1: Report for shareholders giving an overview of business operation in 2022
Report 2: Report providing salespeople performance

**Note: Both reports are available in one pdf file.**

1. Cardinality:
	This involves establishing relationships between different data files which can be many to one, one to one, one to many or many to many.
2. Use of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) commands:
	DAX commands help in creating new columns and creating measures e.g profit per item from sales data.
